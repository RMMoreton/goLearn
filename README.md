# Golang-Heap
### Robert Moreton

Heap provides Golang implementations of both a min-heap and a max-heap using
slices as the backing data structure. In the future, it may be updated to
give the option of using binary trees as the backing data structure.

I am aware that the Golang library provides a heap implementation; this is
for my own benefit.
